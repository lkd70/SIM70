# Quick Setup Guide

## Downloading

If you've not done so already, please go to the [downloads page](https://github.com/lkd70/SIM70/releases/latest)
and grab the latest version of Sim70.

You may notice that there's multiple downloads available, `Sim70.exe` is the easiest to get running.

## The Basics

Sim70 is very simple to get setup for the basic functionality. Just follow these steps:

1. Click the `Sim70.exe` file once it has downloaded.

In some cases Windows will complain that you are trying to run Sim70. This can be safely ignored as shown in the image below

2. Now that Sim70 is running, you'll see a screen like the image below with a weird "grid box" on it.

You will need to click **and hold** down in that box and move the cursor (drag) over to the Ark "Join" button. Once on the join button, release the hold.

Note: Do **not** release the hold on the "Join" text, but the button around the text.

3. Click the big "Start" button and Sim70 will start to automatically join the server. You can now open any other application/game over the top of Ark and enjoy simming for a change.

## Discord Alerts

Sim70 has a feature which will send a message to you in Discord once it thinks you're in the server.

To enable this, head over to the "Notifications" tab in Sim70 and do the following.

5. Paste that URL in to the "Webhook URL" box in Sim70.

6. Add your user or a roles ID to the "Mention ID" text box. You can get your ID in Discord if you have developer mode enabled in the settings by right clicking on your name in a chat.
